I had a lot to catch up on after Devcon. Also things didn't go quite as planned, so please excuse my delayed review!

This year's Devcon was certainly stormy with a big typhoon warning already on day 1. Luckily (for us, not the people in Tokyo), it went right past Osaka. Nevertheless, a lot of people had their flights cancelled. And some we're quite sad about Burning Japan, the Japanese Burning Man, being cancelled as well.

It started quite spectacular with a drum show:

and continued with a review of the last year for the Ethereum Foundation with Aya Miyaguchi. Unfortunately, I was missing a nice review of the latest technical developments which was done last year by Vitalik. This time he gave an interesting, yet very basic talk about cryptoeconomics.'

Food and venue were not as amazing as last year. Especially the small rooms upstairs were constantly overcrowded.

There were a lot of Off-Devcon events, like usual. One of my favorites was the Parity Substrate workshop.

Some of the toilets were surely challenging. Not quite what you expect in Japan and their fancy toilets.

The outdoor Devcon park was great.

And the outdoor stage was a nice concept. However, the talks there were often boring and the sound quality lacked. With the amazing weather, I found myself often relaxing there anyways.

All in all, I found this year's Devcon a great experience, but not as good as last year. However, Osaka and Kyoto were great places to explore. Although, I would have wished to see more Japanese people at the conference.
